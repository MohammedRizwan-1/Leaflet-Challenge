# Leaflet-Challenge


## Introduction
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

The challenege consists of two parts:

### Part 1: Creating the Earthquake visualisation
A map was created using leaflet that plots all the earthqaukes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthqukae by thier size and the depth of the earthquake by colour.

### Part 2: Gathering and Collecting more data
A second dataset was plotted on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

### File Organization and Structure
Located in the parent directory is the static folders and the index.html file.

The static folder contains the css and js folders. The js folder contains the javascript file logic.js that was used to create the html file.
